                    <p>    I was looking through my phone the other day and Icame upon an application that I had't used in a ong whie.
                       At first I was wondering where the blue bird had gone, and why a giant 'X'was on my screen, but then I remembered
                       that Twitter (formally known as such) was renamed to X by it's new owner Elon Musk. The fact that I had forgotten
                       this fact proves just how long I hadn't used this app, but anyway to get to the point I said what the heck and 
                       entered what seem like a mosh pit of hell. Who was going to tell me that we had so many idiots in the world. Ok, ok 
                       maybe I'm exaggerating (a little) and probably coming off a bit pretencious, but come on can you blame me it's it 
                       hurts to loss brain cells. As horrifying as the experience was, I realized it's not just X but across all social media
                       people tend seem to be in a state of needing a common enemy and a new distraction.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>    I see trends rising where people get all thier information from social media and ok fair, we are in a digital
                        age, but they don't even truly do their proper research. Just a quick glimpse at the title of an article, which
                        for all they know could be click-bait, and all of a sudden everyone's an expert on the topic and making tiktoks
                        to spread the little information they  know. Not long after it become wide spread news. Next comes the people 
                        who have to give thier opinions and oh look here comes the ones who disagree. Soon we are in a battle ground
                        where social media advocates against bullying are tell people to die for disagreeing with them and then ofcourse
                        here comes the trolls (at least I hope they are because if not then those opinions are wild). Overall the social
                        media landscape seems like treacherous ground with very high mountains and valleys that sink into hell, where 
                        a tweet from 10 years ago can get you cancelled, or maybe I'm too pessimistic. You all know my motto, 'If you like
                        it, I love it.'

                    <h2>A Rant About House Of The Dragon</h2>

                    <p>
                        Okay I'll admit it, I'm triggered! I just finished watching the second season of House of the Dragon and was
                        left thinking to myself, How could the writer screw up so royally. I look across social media and it seems I am
                        not the only one who shares this notion. Then as I continued to ponder, my anger subsided and then boiled up
                        again, but this time at the audience. For one reason and one reason only, THE WRITING WAS ON THE THE WALL 
                        LIKE HELLO. I remember in 2022 when I posted a blog about season one offering my criticisms and maybe suggesting
                        that this show wasn't the greatest thing since sliced bread and that actually it was quite mediocre, but could be
                        improved. I was meet with a over flowing river of hate, Even when I went to reddit to share my opinion if you
                        weren't praising the show and kissing the feet of the show runner Ryan Condal, then yoy where down voted into 
                        oblivion. Now you all want to complain... all I can do is laugh.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remember when Rhaneys bursted out of the floor on a dragon and killed a bunch of normal citizens, had a clear shot
                        to kill her enemies but choose to just let them live I guess and fight them in war. I remember how they mad Criston
                        Cole into a simp and had him kill a royal knight for no reason and then he faced no cansequences. I remember how 
                        they declawed Alicent and instead of a powerful queen she is now a docile wimp who doesn't want power, oh no it's 
                        the men around her that controll her because godforbid a woman wants power. Lets not forget about our "protagonist"
                        Rhaenyra Targaryan who instead of being a wronged princess who want revenge and her throne, instead is a peaceful
                        pacifist who advocates for peace,peace,peacE, I swear if I hear that word again i'll go crazy. It seems the show 
                        runners think a good female character equals a victim. In conclusion I have just one very important thing to say to 
                        you all so listen very carefully...I told you so.
